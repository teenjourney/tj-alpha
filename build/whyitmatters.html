	<h3>Coming of age in a modern world</h3>
		<p>
				Rites of passage for youth are as old as humanity – they’ve existed far longer than our makeshift versions of getting your driver’s licence, getting your first job, or losing your virginity. Done right, they can ensure a healthy future for the individual and community. Without them, teens can create their own harmful rites of passage that can include drugs, alcohol, and violence. 
				<br><br>
				Our modern culture has not only forgotten how to help our teens enter adulthood, but also squanders the tremendous gifts youth bring to evolve our societies. It is a culture filled with adolescents in adult bodies that didn’t receive the support they needed when young --  it’s one of the main reasons for the challenges today. This “cultural forgetting” fractures our communities because elders lack meaningful ways to share wisdom with the young, youth lack access to mentors and role models, and our culture lacks the fire of youthful vision and action. 
				<br><br>
				Teen Journey is working to change that for the coming generations.

			<h4>Teen Journey is a guiding hand</h4>
			<br><br>
			<p>
Teen Journey goes far beyond an ordinary teen camp experience. Sure, it has many of the fun activities associated with summer camp and the opportunity to create long-lasting friendships. But, more than that, there’s also an invitation for each teen to truly look into who they are and what it means to be a human being. Our camps are designed as a modern rite of passage that will prepare your teenager to truly embrace their own life’s journey.<br><br>
When a teen learns what it feels like to be themselves, be connected to their peers, and be a part of nature, they begin to discover how life is filled with opportunities to discover who they are. The journey into adulthood then starts from a place of inner motivation to fulfill their deeply-felt personal calling. Through a variety of safe, but profound exploratory tools and stimulating social settings, teens face and move beyond their fears to discover their true nature. These new rites of passage are essential for them to step into the unknown with self-acceptance and to  trust in their own inner guidance.<br><br>
For the community, rites of passage restore wholeness, meaning, connection, and a feeling of renewal for all. By imparting cultural values and a sense of personal responsibility between generations, our communities are more creative and resilient at facing challenges. Teen Journey helps build stronger community relationships through this work. 		</p>

			<h2>Rites of passage: a three-part experience</h2>
			<br><br>
			<p>While academic education focuses on preparing teens to enter the workforce, we educate teens to access their life-force. Our rites of passage enrich your teen’s appreciation for cultural traditions, personal and social responsibilities, connection to nature, and a sense of personal purpose. In realizing their unique gifts and the power of intuition, teens can see what and how they can contribute to their community and the world. They become much more likely to lead fulfilling lives and avoid prolonged states of distraction, apathy, and depression.<br><br>
Our rites of passage are modelled on the traditional three-part experience found in cultures all over the world. Depending on a teen’s age and readiness, they’ll experience each part to different degrees. </p>
			<br><br>
			<h5>Separation from the known to the unknown</h5>
			<p>Being an adult isn’t just about reaching a certain age or accepting certain responsibilities. Teens must undergo a process that requires letting go of the familiar and comfortable as they enter a foreign world to discover who they are what they carry hidden within them. The journey into the unknown begins here. </p>
			<br><br>
			<h5>Facing ordeals and receiving the gift</h5>
			<p>Through physical and psychological tests and adventures, teens face their fears, overcome limitations, discover creative capacities, open their hearts, and receive a gift that they carry forth into the world. </p>
						<br><br>
			<h5>Return to the village</h5>
			<p>In returning to their families and the community, teens are received with a respect for – and celebration of  – their newfound self-awareness and the journey taken to develop it. Now, they have the chance to share their discoveries and be acknowledged for the gift that they carry forth.</p>

				<h3>Educating the heart</h3>
						<br><br>
						<p>The Dalai Lama's vision for youth is essentially to "educate the heart" – an education that is not merely about developing the mind and getting good grades. Rather, it is about learning empathy. Much of the confidence and empowerment that teens seek actually comes from being compassionate to others – and that’s the main foundation of educating the heart. Too often, our society’s encouragement of competition and pursuit of power finds its way into schools, spreading insecurity and isolation in young culture. </p>

							</article>
							<br><br>
							
							<p><br><br>At Teen Journey, our programs place educating the heart as the core of our values. Like the Dalai Lama encourages, such an educations transmits and “reflects the values of compassion, mutual understanding, inner well-being, mindfulness, creativity, peacefulness, warm heartedness, aspiration, and interconnectedness.”
						<br><br>
							Our world needs every young person it can get to develop into authentic and compassionate individuals who are aware of their gifts and are willing to use them to serve others. We have discovered that educating the heart is more direct and impactful way to bring this about.

				<h2>Following our personal destiny</h2>
				<br><br>
					<p>
							“It’s [your Personal Legend] what you have always wanted to accomplish. Everyone, when they are young, knows what their Personal Legend is. At that point in their lives, everything is clear and everything is possible. They are not afraid to dream, and to yearn for everything they would like to see happen to them in their lives. But, as time passes, a mysterious force begins to convince them that it will be impossible for them to realize their Personal Legend.”
							<span class="quoteName">– The Alchemist, Paolo Coehlo</span>
							
							<br><br>
							Fulfilling our destiny (or personal legend in The Alchemist) is the ultimate rite of passage, consisting of the many choices that we make throughout our lives. We may discover that once we fulfill what we think is our destiny another calling appears to us, or that when we hear the call we fail to follow it. The key is not how many times we fail or how many callings we have, but that we arise each time to pursue the calling of our hearts. 
							<br><br>
							But the challenges most of us face are:
							<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="icon-dot"></i>How do we listen to our intuition and let it direct our destiny?<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="icon-dot"></i>How can we be confident to overcome the resistance of aligning our actions with our dreams?
							<br><br>
							Teen Journey helps prepare teens with the tools, experiences, and mentorship that will encourage them to pursue their personal destiny. It starts with learning how to discover who we are, committing to the ongoing process of self-discovery, and taking responsibility for the significance of the choices that make up our lives. We use myths and stories to activate teens imaginations so they can begin to see their own life as a story that they are co-authoring with the world.

				<h2>Co-creating the Village</h2>
				<br><br>
					<p>
If our world seems so connected, then why do we feel isolated and aloof?

When the Vancouver Foundation asked charities and community leaders about our area’s biggest challenge, the top issue wasn’t affordability or homelessness – it was a growing sense of isolation and disconnection.
<br><br>
<a href="http://www.vancouverfoundation.ca/initiatives/connections-and-engagement" class="textLink" alt="Learn more about the survey"> Click here to learn more about the survey</a>
<br><br>
At Teen Journey, mentors, teens, families and the larger community collaborate on equal footing to create an inclusive village environment. We draw upon the wisdom of traditional cultures to create a place where Teens can be themselves, where they are accepted and recognized for their innate gifts and authentic expressions. The spirit of the village still lives within us, and we draw on its power to inspire a meaningful and enduring experience for teens while offering them a vision of a more engaged society.
