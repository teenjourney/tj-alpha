			<h3>“On Children”</h3>
			<h5><span class="quoteName">– Kahlil Gibran (1923)</span></h5>
			<br><br>
			<p>Your children are not your children.<br>
			They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.<br>
			They come through you but not from you,<br>
			And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.</p>
			<br><br>
			<p>You may give them your love but not your thoughts,<br>
			For they have their own thoughts.<br>
			You may house their bodies but not their souls,<br>
			For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow,<br>
			which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.<br>
			You may strive to be like them,<br>
			but seek not to make them like you.<br>
			For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.</p>
			<br><br>
			<p>You are the bows from which your children<br>
			as living arrows are sent forth.<br>
			The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite,<br>
			and He bends you with His might<br>
			that His arrows may go swift and far.<br>
			Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness;<br>
			For even as He loves the arrow that flies,<br>
			so He loves also the bow that is stable.</p>

			<h3>Intention</h3>
			<br><br>
			<p>In this two-and-half-day intensive that complements Teen Journey, parents get support from workshop leaders, exchange skills, and tap into their responsibilities for parenting tomorrow’s generation. We invite the parents to explore further and deeper the same questions the teens will be facing: Who are we? What are we here for?</p>

			<h3>Why this is important for you as a parent</h3>
			<br><br>
			<p>Looking around at the number of parenting, mothering, and family magazines, we were shocked to discover none that addressed the very real issues parents of teenagers face. It led us to the realization that our society is ill-equipped to deal with the pressing realities of raising a teenager, mostly because we ourselves had little real guidance then.
			<br><br>
			Parenting itself is a long journey with many bumps along the road. The tools you had for parenting babies and young children turn out to be completely ineffective for parenting teens. At this time, your journey as a parent undergoes a profound shift. You find yourself challenged as you have never been before. Once sweet and gentle, children may now question you about who you truly are and everything you stand for.
			<br><br>
			At Parent Journey, you will recognize the lost connection you did not receive when you were a teen and profoundly understand this transition so that you can more lovingly and effectively support your teens. This is more than just a program, itʼs an invitation for the parents to initiate themselves into a conscious and heart-centered community where we work together to nurture true human beings. Our goal will be to empower ourselves and one another, to exchange skills, and to tap into our role as true elders who are bringing up a generation of highly-responsible young people.
			<br><br>
			The powerful rites of passage the teens experience at Teen Journey will be even more powerful when met with a shift in consciousness of the parents who choose to go on Parent Journey this summer. In these times of fragmented community and loss of village-like connections, we have a lot to gain by removing ourselves from our daily lives so that we can strengthen, clarify, and renew our purpose together.
			<br><br>
			The past few years have shown us how effective these rites of passage have been for the teens. Every year, we invited parents to prepare the return-to-the-village ritual and provided them with some extraordinary tools to aid the cross-generational communication. </p>
