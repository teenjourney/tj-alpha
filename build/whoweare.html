Her spiritual search led her to meet with Eckhart Tolle in 1998 whose teachings were instrumental in the deepening of her inner journey. In 2011 she discovered Teen Journey. She realized the program was providing the youth with what she had been yearning for herself as an adolescent, and could not find.

							<p>The vision of Teen Journey came to Ela Rezmer in a remarkable and unexpected call from her heart to create a community where teens could fully explore and discover themselves, their talents and their values.
			She began gathering people who are passionately committed to themselves and their inner journey; people who also have the desire to share their gifts and wisdom with teens. These mentors help and guide young people through their own personal journey of self-discovery. Without hesitation these leaders came to Teen Journey giving their time, their stories and their inspiration.
			<br><br>
			Answering the call is a group of volunteers and mentors committed to bridging tribal wisdom with modern culture. Many people have contributed their time and energy to Teen Journey, including people like Malidoma Somé, Dr Vernon Woolfe, Juan Ruiz Naupari of Inkarri and Pneuma – people who are passionate and renowned professionals in their respective fields. As an organization, we already exist in a global village, and are re-connecting with the roots and traditions of the cultures around us to connect the wisdom of sages and scientists. Each of the passionate and committed volunteers and leaders of Teen Journey brings a lifetime of self-exploration and mentorship to our community and its events.
			<br><br>
			The people of Teen Journey have united around a purpose. Every leader and volunteer has come together around a common cause: to be in service to youth and create wholeness and connection among their families. The underlying purpose and vision of Teen Journey constantly attracts new and remarkable people. Please connect with us if you hear the call.
			<br><br>
			If you recognize the importance of this work, we call upon you to donate to our organization so that we can reach more youth with our incredible programs!</p>
