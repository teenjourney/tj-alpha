			<p>Teen Journey takes a deeply rooted and holistic approach the healthy development of a teen transitioning through adolescence.<br><br>
	While many summer programs for youth focus on the outer development of a teen, we help them grow inside and out. We also include the parents in our programming, recognizing that when teens and parents grow together, the results are far more effective.</p>

				<h3>Our story</h3>
				<br><br>
				<p>The vision of Teen Journey came to Ela Rezmer in a remarkable and unexpected call from her heart: to create a community where teens could fully explore and discover themselves, their talents and their values. She began gathering people who are passionately committed to themselves and their inner journey; people who also have the desire to share their gifts and wisdom with teens. These mentors help and guide young people through their own personal journey of self-discovery. Without hesitation, these leaders came to Teen Journey giving their time, stories, and inspiration.
				<br><br>
				Answering the call is a group of volunteers and mentors committed to bridging tribal wisdom with modern culture. Many people have contributed their time and energy to Teen Journey, including people like Malidoma Somé, Dr Vernon Woolfe, Juan Ruiz Naupari of Inkarri and Pneuma – people who are passionate and renowned professionals in their respective fields. As an organization that's part of a global village, we connect with cultural roots and traditions, and wisdom of sages and scientists. Each passionate, committed volunteer and leader brings a lifetime of self-exploration and mentorship to our community and its events.
				<br><br>
				The people of Teen Journey have united around a purpose: to be of service to youth and to create wholeness and connection among their families. The underlying purpose and vision of Teen Journey constantly attracts new and remarkable people. Please connect with us if you hear the call.
